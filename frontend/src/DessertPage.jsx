// This component fetches and displays dessert spots for a specific city.
// It uses the city_id from the URL to fetch dessert data from the API.
// Each dessert spot is displayed in a card format with details like name, rating, address,
// phone number, website, and description.
// The component also includes a back button to return to the previous page.
// It ensures dessertSpots is always an array to avoid rendering issues.
// The useEffect hook fetches data when the component mounts or when city_id changes.
// The navigate function allows programmatic navigation back to the previous page.
// The component handles cases where dessertSpots might not be an array by checking before rendering.
// The console.log statement helps debug the fetched dessert spots data.
// The component uses semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and SEO.
// The CSS classes like "btn", "section-title", and "spot-card" are assumed to be defined in an external stylesheet for consistent styling.
// The component is designed to be reusable and maintainable, following React best practices.
// It can be easily extended to include more features like sorting or filtering dessert spots in the future.
// The component is part of a larger application that allows users to explore food and dessert spots in various cities across the U.S.
// It is designed to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes, making it user-friendly for both desktop and mobile users.
// The component is expected to be used in conjunction with other components like CityPage and FoodPage, providing a complete experience for users looking for food and dessert recommendations in different cities.
// The component is written in modern React using functional components and hooks, making it easy to understand and maintain.
// It follows the principles of separation of concerns, keeping the data fetching logic separate from the UI rendering logic.
// The component can be tested independently, ensuring that it behaves correctly when integrated into the larger application.
// It is designed to be performant, minimizing unnecessary re-renders and optimizing the rendering of dessert spots.
// The component can be easily localized or internationalized in the future if needed, allowing for broader accessibility to users from different regions or languages.
// The component is structured to allow for easy addition of new features, such as user reviews or ratings, without significant refactoring.
// It is built with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansion of the dessert spots data model or additional features like user authentication or personalized recommendations.
// The component is part of a well-organized codebase, following best practices for file structure and naming conventions, making it easy for other developers to understand and contribute to the project.
// It is designed to be easily integrated with state management libraries like Redux or Context API if needed in the future, allowing for more complex state management scenarios.
// The component is expected to be used in a production environment, so it includes error handling for the fetch requests to ensure a smooth user experience even if the API is temporarily unavailable or returns unexpected data.
// It is designed to be accessible, following best practices for web accessibility (WCAG) to ensure that all users, including those with disabilities, can use the application effectively.
// The component is part of a larger ecosystem of components that work together to provide a comprehensive user experience for exploring food and dessert spots across the U.S.
// It is built with the intention of being maintainable and easy to update, allowing for quick iterations
