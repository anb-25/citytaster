# This Dockerfile sets up a Node.js development environment for a React application.
# It installs dependencies using npm, exposes port 3000, and runs the development server.
# It uses a Node.js base image and sets the working directory to /app.
# It installs both dependencies and devDependencies (so Vite CLI is available).
# It builds the React app with Vite and serves the static output via Nginx.
# It uses a multi-stage build to keep the final image small by only copying the build output.
# It first builds the React app using Vite, then serves the static files with Nginx.
# It copies the necessary configuration files and source code to build the application.
