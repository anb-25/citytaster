<!-- Why you need this single HTML file:

1. Entry point for the browser: Browsers always start by loading an HTML page. This file tells the browser where to inject your React app.

2. Root element (<div id="root">): ReactDOM looks for this ID and renders your entire component tree inside it.

3. Meta tags

charset="UTF-8" ensures text displays correctly.

viewport makes the app scale to mobile devices.

4. Vite injection placeholder

During development, Vite injects a module script pointing at your entrypoint (main.jsx).

During production, it injects <script> and <link> tags for the optimized bundles.

5. <noscript> fallback
Notifies users that JavaScript is required for your SPA to function.

With this in place as frontend/public/index.html, your React/Vite build process will correctly mount the app and handle all routing client-side. -->

<!-- frontend/index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!-- 1. Character encoding for proper text rendering -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />

  <!-- 2. Responsive viewport for mobile devices -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

  <!-- 3. Title shown in the browser tab -->
  <title>CityTaster</title>

  <!-- 
    4. Viteâ€™s entrypoint script:
       - In development, Vite serves `/src/main.jsx` with HMR.
       - In production build, Vite rewrites this to your bundled files in /dist.
  -->
  <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- 5. React will mount into this div -->
  <div id="root"></div>

  <!-- 6. Fallback message for users without JavaScript -->
